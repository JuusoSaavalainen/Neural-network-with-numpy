# Weekly Report 5

## Implementing model in OOP style, fixes and testing

This week my work with this project was minimal compared to last ones. I did implement the utilyty file as an class. I also did some better file manging regarding main.py. Fixed some hardcoded paths. Tested the feedforward function.

Hardest task this week was managing time and making the correct checks to debug more efficiently. I feel like i also didnt learn this week so much. Most of the learning was done via peer review.

## Next Week

- MAIN GOAL: Produce meaningful tests to the remaining backprop algorithm

- Run autopep8 again, manage depencies most of them are not used rightnow

- Clean code, especially with GUI. Cli is mvp so adding error expectations at least should be done next week

- Comparison between different models and times with plots. And generally finishing still in progress docs.
