# Weekly Report 6

## Fixing the Cli and organizing files to classes, starting comparisons of speed, accuracy and losses

This week most of the work was organazing. I added error expectation to cli and made it own module. Main file is only the ignite for the rest of the files now. Cli takes care of training. Also runned linting and did some model comparison. 
The backpropagation algorithm still needs to be tested and documentation needs to be finished. Rest of the stuff is in good place now. Peer review was the best lerning experince of this week. 

## Next Week

- Produce meaningful tests to the remaining backprop algorithm
- Comparison between different models and times with plots. And generally finishing still in progress docs.
- Finnishing the project
