# Weekly Report

## Implementing the Neural Network

This week, the main focus was on implementing the model. After many attempts and rewrites, it now actually does something. Last week, I had set up the other parts, so I thought this week would be easier, but it wasn't. I feel like I learned even more this week than in previous weeks. Last week, I was getting to know this topic (I'm still learning), but this week I actually got to implement things like backpropagation.

The complexity of the implementation became overwhelming, and I had to rewrite large parts of the program several times. The second problem was getting everything to work correctly, even though the code looked good. I spent a lot of time trying to find the problems that were resulting in bad learning results or none. There is still work to be done with the main parts, but I feel like it's in relatively good shape now.

I want to point out that the debugging and failures during this week were the most productive moments, and printing (np).shapes all over really helped me understand the types of variables I was working with.

## Next Week
- Test the main things in the model
- Start doing more analytic docs
- Clean the main files
- Maybe implement it in an OOP manner as an object
