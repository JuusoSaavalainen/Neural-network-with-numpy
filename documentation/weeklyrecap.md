# Weekly report

## Getting to know what im about to do
The first week of this project was dedicated to learn as much as possible what is about to come and how everything should be done. Different approaches were also evaluated to find the optimal way to learn and also get something done. So zero lines of code this week.

I learned lot about the basic structure of a simple neural network. On top of that many methods like forward pass, backpropagation, loss function, gradient descen, training process and implementation of these concepts were things i dived into this week. I tried to get the basic knoledge of the whole concept and with that understand as much as i can about these things that im about to apply in my work. And i did learn.

Of course building and training such models are still mystery to me. Especially the implementation of the math is thing that i need to learn more so i can choose the best ways of doing things like activation function and actually choose the right one to fit this type of approach. Biggest of all things that makes me nervous is the testing such model in right way. That is something i will be focusing next weeks + all other stuff that i still dont know.
