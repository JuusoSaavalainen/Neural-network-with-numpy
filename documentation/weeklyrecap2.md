# Weekly report

## Preparing the data and getting familiar with the topic and the methods
This week most of my time was spent on formatting the original data. Getting the data to CSV format ready to be used. Besides that, I also did start testing and setting up the whole skeleton of a project. For example GitHub Actions / CI/CD and codecov. After the first week I got a grasp of what I'm going to do, and this week I kept learning more about the whole concept. I did write some code this week too, almost half of it was tests.

I want to mention that I also did the planning of the whole project mostly this week. I feel like I'm in a good position to start implementing the main parts of this project after this week.

## Next week
Keep reading docs, Start to implement some of the main parts and maybe test training, Do more documentation, and finish the configuration hopefully.
